[0-add.py](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-python-import_modules/0-add.py) - a program that imports the function `def add(a, b)`: from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3`
- the value `1` is assigned to a variable called `a`
- the value `2` is assigned to a variable called `b`
- the two variables as arguments when calling the functions `add` and `print`

[1-calculation.py](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-python-import_modules/1-calculation.py) - a program that imports functions from the file `calculator_1.py`, does some Maths, and prints the result.
- the value `10` is defined to a variable `a`
